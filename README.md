# Multinomial Logistic Regression

This repository provides a Multinomial Logistic Regression model for the classification problem of multiple classes.

The novelity of this model is that it is implemented with the deep learning framework 'Pytorch'

### Organization

- `MNL.py`: this python module contains the implementation of Multinomial Logistic Regression model that is implemented with Pytorch.

- 'MNL_aux.py`: this python module provides some auxiliary functions in complement with the `MNL.py` model, e.g. train the model with early stopping on the error delta threshold.
